  <h2><strong>SOCCER</strong></h2>

  <p>I've been watching soccer all of life. it all started with my father just watching as he normally would. soon after I started to pay attention to what was happening. That naturally leads to a nutural gravitation of a perfered team. This of coourse has been something in family that has cause heated yet freindly debates among us. As my father and I supported a different team as my sister.</p>
  
  <p>Instead of watching the much larger leagus from the europion side. I stared much closer to what i call home and have devoutadly watched <strong>Liga MX</strong></p>
