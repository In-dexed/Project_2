  <h1>This is my Home Page</h1>
  <p>My name is John Vazquez. Im a first year Information Technology and Managment.</p>
  <p>This website will not only contane my credentials and abilites. but will also get an insight to what I enjoy outside of my intended area of study.</p>
  <p>im from Wauekegan illinois; ahout 1.5 hours away from Illinois Institute of Technology. One thing cool about Waukegan is that the author Ray Bradbury is from there and that there is a statue of Bradbury outside of out publix library.</p>
  <p>Living in that area there are many things to explore such as the BMX track, field house, and History of waikegan. </p>
